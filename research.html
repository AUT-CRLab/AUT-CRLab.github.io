  <p>
   2 phase Victim Detection and 3D pose estimation system implemented for a rescue robot.<br>
- In the first stage an Object Detection method used to detect the lying-down human bodies(victims).<br>
- In second stage a CNN algorithm is used to find body joints information then this joints are used to reconstruct a 3D model of human
    body and camera pose by applying matching pursuit algorithm in order to estimate the sparse representation of 3D pose and the relative
    camera from only 2D image evidence.<br> 

This Project is going to be submmited as: M. TaherAhmadi, S. Azami, S. Shiry, ”2 Stage Victim Detection and Pose Estimation from 2D Images 
    for a Rescue Robot” In Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS. IEEE/RSJ International Conference. IEEE, 2017. <p>
