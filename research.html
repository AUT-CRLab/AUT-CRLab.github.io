  <h3>Victim Detection and 3D Pose Estimation from 2D Images for a Rescue Robot</h3>
  <img class="floating" src="images/victimpose.png" width="120" height="120" alt="vitctimpose">
  <p>
   2 phase Victim Detection and 3D pose estimation system implemented for a rescue robot.<br>
- In the first stage an Object Detection method used to detect the lying-down human bodies(victims).<br>
- In second stage a CNN algorithm is used to find body joints information then this joints are used to reconstruct a 3D model of human
    body and camera pose by applying matching pursuit algorithm in order to estimate the sparse representation of 3D pose and the relative
    camera from only 2D image evidence.<br> 

This Project is going to be submmited as: M. TaherAhmadi, S. Azami, S. Shiry, ”2 Stage Victim Detection and Pose Estimation from 2D Images 
    for a Rescue Robot” In Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS. IEEE/RSJ International Conference. IEEE, 2017. <p>

  <h3>Community Detection in Social Networks</h3>
  <img class="floating" src="images/communitis-graph.png" width="120	" height="120" alt="communitis-graph">
  <p>
    In this project we used Louvain Method implementation from pyhton NetworkX library for community detection in social networks.
    Modularity is a scale value between -1 and 1 that measures the density of edges inside communities to edges outside communities.
    Optimizing this value theoretically results in the best possible grouping of the nodes of a given network.
    This method is a greedy optimization method that appears to run in time O(n log n). <p>
